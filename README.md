A PLEN Robot Derivative designed at China . We love the PLEN2 robot but its expensive. This is our take on a lower cost version of the PLEN2 robot using 9g servo's.

The 3d printed parts are inspired by the PLEN2 parts but were redrawn from scratch to make use of the cheaper 9g servo motors.

Note: This is a work in progress. We are still busy building and testing it. Proceed at own risk :)
